# Script to compile and run all test harnesses automatically. This is intended to be used for checking for
# regressions. If you're making a major change to the code you should run this script after you have done
# so to help you find bugs you have introduced!
#
# This relies on a specially configured makefile where the test harness targets are between
# two special comments in the make file (#TEST HARNESSES START & #TESTHARNESSES END).
# Under the recipe for each rule one or more comment(s) of the form "#ARGS <argument1> <argument2> ..."
# are placed under the recipe for each rule. These comments tell this script how to call each test harness
# once is has been compiled.
